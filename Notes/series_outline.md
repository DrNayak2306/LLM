# Series outline

## Stage 1 - Buillding an LLM
1. Data preparation and sampling
2. Attention mechanism
3. LLM architecture

## Stage 2 - Pretraining on unlabelled data
1. Training loop
2. Model evaluation
3. Load pretrained weights

## Stage 3 - Finetuning
1. Classifer
2. Personal assistant

Common mistake - Jumping directly to stage 3 and deploying applications using LangChain etc..
